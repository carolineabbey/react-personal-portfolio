Personal Portfolio Using React - Caroline Abbey

Project Description:
This is my portfolio website I created using React.js, showcasing three college projects I have felt show my passion the best. I want to go into UX design 
so I decided to include projects and descriptions centered around that profession. I included a mini case study using figma and two web pages that I built 
using HTML and CSS. This website has multiple pages including a home page, about me page, portfolio page, and a contact page.

Setup Instuctions:
I started by creating a new repository and then creating the project in the terminal using vite. I then used the terminal to create the folder and file stucture
including pages for each section and components for the consistent things happening on each page. I then set up my app.jsx for the routing of the website. I then
set up my other files, including form validation for the contact page, and styled the whole thing with css. I then committed my changes and deployed using 

Features:
- smooth scrolling on the home page to show about me section.
- nav bar buttons.
- form validation on contact page.
- links to external websites.
- milti-page website.
