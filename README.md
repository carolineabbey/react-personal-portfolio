Personal Portfolio Using React - Caroline Abbey

Project Description:
This is my portfolio website I created using React.js, showcasing three college projects I have felt show my passion the best. I want to go into UX design 
so I decided to include projects and descriptions centered around that profession. I included a mini case study using figma and two web pages that I built 
using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. This website has multiple pages including a home page, about me page, portfolio page, and a contact page.

Setup Instuctions:
I started by creating a new repository and then creating the project in the terminal using vite. I then installed framer motion for the animation on the 
home page and smooth scroll for the smooth scrolling on the home page. I then used the terminal to create the folder and file stucture including files for 
each page and components for the consistent things happening on each page. I also created an extra css file to handle the home page animations, background 
image, and smooth scrolling. I then set up my app.jsx for the routing of the website. I then set up my other files, including form validation for the contact 
page, and styled the whole thing with the two css files and some minimal styled components. I then committed my changes and deployed using netlify as this was 
the easiest and best choice for this type of project and because of my use of vite.

Features:
- smooth scrolling on the home page to show about me section.
- framer motion animation on home page.(fades into second section)
- nav bar buttons.
- form validation on contact page.
- links to external websites.
- milti-page website.
